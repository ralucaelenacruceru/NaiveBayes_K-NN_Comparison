The two algorithms I'm going to compare in this documentation feature two supervised learning methods: k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes, which highlight quite different characteristics. This can also be seen from the interpretation of the result. The data set used was chosen in such a way as to bring insight into how the data is manipulated in each of the cases, being an analysis of the metabolites found in the urine in the presence of different amounts of drug treatment. The study involves the participation of 4 people of various ages and with various conditions.
